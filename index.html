                    Yo sé que estoy en tu corazón,<br> quizá en el fondo
                    Otra baby me escribe, nunca le respondo (No)<br>
                    La vida da vuelta' y el mundo es redondo<br>
                    Y yo voy a que te beso de nuevo en London<br>
                    O si no en Marbella (¡Wuh!)<br>

                    Yo sé que ni la' ola' han borra'o mi huella (Yeh)<br>
                    Pero tu pichaera e' lo que me atropella
                    Sol,<br> playa y en la arena, vamo' allá (¡Wuh!)<br>
                    Baby, no te quede' callá'
                    Yo sé que tú quiere' guayar conmigo<br>
                    Otra vez me tienes en depresión<br>

                <h2>The Life of Samuel Jackson</h2>

                <div>

                    <p>To such a degree of unrestrained frankness had he now accustomed me, that in the course of this evening I talked of the numerous reflections which had been 
                    thrown out against him on account of his having accepted a pension from his present Majesty. 'Why, Sir, (said he, with a hearty laugh,) it is a mighty foolish 
                    noise that they make. I have accepted of a pension as a reward which has been thought due to my literary merit; and now that I have this pension, I am the same 
                    man in every respect that I have ever been; I retain the same principles. It is true, that I cannot now curse (smiling) the House of Hanover; nor would it be 
                    decent for me to drink King James's health in the wine that King George gives me money to pay for. But, Sir, I think that the pleasure of cursing the House of 
                    Hanover, and drinking King James's health, are amply overbalanced by three hundred pounds a year.'</p>

                    <p>There was here, most certainly, an affectation of more Jacobitism than he really had. Yet there is no doubt that at earlier periods he was wont often to exercise both his 
                     pleasantry and ingenuity in talking Jacobitism. My much respected friend, Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury, has favoured me with the following admirable instance from his 
                     Lordship's own recollection. One day, when dining at old Mr. Langton's where Miss Roberts, his niece, was one of the company, Johnson, with his usual complacent attention to 
                     the fair sex, took her by the hand and said, 'My dear, I hope you are a Jacobite.' Old Mr. Langton, who, though a high and steady Tory, was attached to the present Royal Family, 
                     seemed offended, and asked Johnson, with great warmth, what he could mean by putting such a question to his niece? 'Why, Sir, (said Johnson) I meant no offence to your niece, I 
                     meant her a great compliment. A Jacobite, Sir, believes in the divine right of Kings. He that believes in the divine right of Kings believes in a Divinity. A Jacobite believes in
                      the divine right of Bishops. He that believes in the divine right of Bishops believes in the divine authority of the Christian religion. Therefore, Sir, a Jacobite is neither an 
                      Atheist nor a Deist. That cannot be said of a Whig; for Whiggism is a negation of all principle.'</p>

                    <p>He advised me, when abroad, to be as much as I could with the Professors in the Universities, and with the Clergy; for from their conversation I might expect the best accounts of
                     every thing in whatever country I should be, with the additional advantage of keeping my learning alive.</p>

                    <p>It will be observed, that when giving me advice as to my travels, Dr. Johnson did not dwell upon cities, and palaces, and pictures, and shows, and Arcadian scenes. He was of Lord 
                    Essex's opinion, who advises his kinsman Roger Earl of Rutland, 'rather to go an hundred miles to speak with one wise man, than five miles to see a fair town.'</p>

                    <p>I described to him an impudent fellow from Scotland, who affected to be a savage, and railed at all established systems. JOHNSON. 'There is nothing surprizing in this, Sir. He wants 
                    to make himself conspicuous. He would tumble in a hogstye, as long as you looked at him and called to him to come out. But let him alone, never mind him, and he'll soon give it over.'</p>
